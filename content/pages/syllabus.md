Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

At least one of the following prerequisites is required:

[_7.03 Genetics_](/courses/7-03-genetics-fall-2004/)

_7.05 General Biochemistry_

[_7.06 Cell Biology_](/courses/7-06-cell-biology-spring-2007/)

[_7.28 Molecular Biology_](/courses/7-28-molecular-biology-spring-2005/)

Course Description
------------------

In the western world, approximately 10–15% of couples suffer from subfertility. Consequently, over 5 million babies have been born thanks to assisted reproductive technologies, and more than half of those have been born in the past six years alone. In some countries, 3–5% of births are achieved with assisted reproductive technologies, and this number is projected to grow as societies are increasingly interested in beating the biological clock.

This class will cover the basic biology behind fertility and explore the etiology of infertility. We will cover the latest developments in reproductive science and discuss the clinical challenges of translating research findings into medical treatments. We will discuss recent studies of gonadal stem cells and their use for rejuvenation of fertility, oocyte and embryo cryopreservation studies and usage, current diagnostic tools for common causes of male infertility, and key mouse models with reproductive phenotypes. This class will highlight open questions in reproductive biology, familiarize students with both tried-and-true and emerging reproductive technologies, and explore the advantages and pitfalls of each. Students will have the opportunity to visit a Boston-area IVF clinic and speak with researchers who are on the front lines of reproductive technologies.

Objectives and Format
---------------------

The main aim of this course is to teach the students how to critically read and discuss scientific papers. Students will read two papers from the primary research literature before coming to each class. This reading is essential, since the class will be based on discussion of these papers. Figures and tables will be projected using PowerPoint, and the entire class will participate in discussions of this material. Experimental design, control experiments, materials and methods, data and appropriateness of interpretations will be discussed. At the end of each class, the instructor will give a short introduction to the papers for the following week.

Grading
-------

The class is graded on a pass / fail basis. A passing grade will be given to students who attend the course, participate in discussions, and satisfactorily complete the assignments.
